# Kraxbot 4
### The source code behind [0x0bf3f39](https://steamcommunity.com/id/kraxbot)

Complete rewrite of the closed source Kraxbot up to 3.2.6 in C# instead of JavaScript. Main point of this repository is for others to take a look behind the hood of 0x0bf3f39, not really running it themselves, though, if you want to, you of course can. There just won't be any help or support. If you really want to run it yourself, check out [KraxbotOSS](https://github.com/kraxarn/KraxbotOSS) instead.
